# Analysis Approach & Business Thinking

This project was approached from a business analyst perspective, focusing on converting unstructured customer feedback into actionable insights.

## Key Analytical Considerations

- Identified recurring themes rather than isolated complaints
- Compared sentiment drivers across competitors
- Linked customer pain points directly to business impact

## Why This Matters
Understanding customer sentiment at scale helps businesses:
- Improve customer experience
- Reduce churn
- Strengthen brand trust
- Align product and marketing strategies with real customer needs
